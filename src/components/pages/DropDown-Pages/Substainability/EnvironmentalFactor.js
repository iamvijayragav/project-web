        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The environmental factor in the ESG equation focuses on how a company
          performs as a steward of nature. It considers how a company uses
          natural resources and how their operations impact the environment. It
          includes not only a company’s direct operations, but also all
          activities across their supply chains. Responsible and effective
          management of environmental factors is an increasingly important
          driver of corporate value.

          <div className="engineer-serviced">
            <p>
              Environmental concerns can be understood in terms of an
              organization’s outputs and inputs. Outputs consist of what and how
              much the organization produces. Inputs factor in the
              sustainability of the resources required to feed the
              organization’s processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no all-inclusive list of environmental factors, and some
              may overlap with social and governance factors. While some
              environmental factors are universal, such as waste reduction, a
              company will also be evaluated based on industry-specific issues,
              such as the elimination of biohazards in the medical industry or
              the reduction of flaring in oil and gas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although exact terminology varies, ESG rating agencies generally
              classify environmental factors according to four major themes:
              Climate Change, Natural Resources, Pollution & Waste, and
              Environmental Opportunities. Within each theme, multiple key
              issues are analyzed to arrive at key performance indicators.
            </p>
            <p> These environmental themes and issues are summarized below.</p>
