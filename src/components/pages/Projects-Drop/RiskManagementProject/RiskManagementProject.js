            <p>
              Tecnicoe was contracted to develop a Process Safety Management
              (PSM) program for a liquid handling facility located in West
              Texas. Tecnicoe worked with the operator to determine if the
              facility falls under the oversight of PSM and then developed all
              required documentation and training in order to comply with 29 CFR
              1910.119.

            <p>
              Tecnicoe was contracted to provide due diligence to a midstream
              company during their acquisition of a facility located in West
              Texas. The facility consisted of a pipeline gathering system, nine
              compressor stations, and one process plant. A review of all
              available facility documentation including: design specs, pipeline
              MAOP calculations, ProMax process model, NACE documentation, and
              other process safety information. In addition, Tecnicoe reviewed
              the facility corrosion monitoring program, all regulatory
              compliance items, and the mechanical integrity program.
