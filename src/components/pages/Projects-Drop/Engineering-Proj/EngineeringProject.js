            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>
              Tecnicoe was contracted to design and construct a production
              facility on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska for 20 oil production
              and 10 water injection wells. The project was completed on
              schedule and under budget in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facility contains oil and gas processing equipment and is
              rated at a capacity of 10,000 BOPD, 10,000 BWPD, and 15 MMSCFD.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facility includes equipment to process, treat, and export
              natural gas to the local pipeline utility by using a series of
              reciprocating gas compressors, glycol dehydration, and onsite
              measurement. Oil is treated through separation, heat and
              filtration, and chemical treating before being metered through
              LACT units and exported by truck. Water is separated, treated, and
              stored in tanks before being exported offsite.

              discharge at 450 BPH and 400 PSIG. Space has been allocated for

              in Amarillo, TX. The goal of the repurposing project was to bypass
              and abandon the existing cryogenic treatment facilities while
              providing a fit for purpose upgrade to existing process equipment
              and the addition of new equipment in order to meet the required
              specifications for sales of gas and liquids to a new buyer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design flow rates for the repurposing project were 50 MMSCFD with
              up to 300 PPM H2S and 2% CO2 and 2,500 BLPD with up to 1,200 ppm
              H2S and .1% CO2. The facility repurposing was designed and
              organized in a way that would allow for the facility to remain
              operational as much as possible during the construction phase.

            <p>
              Tecnicoe was contracted to design and reconstruct a compressor
              station in Potter County, Pennsylvania. The compressor station
              required modifications to safely return to operations. M&H’s scope
              included PreFEED, FEED, detailed design, and onsite construction
              support.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary focus was the replacement of the dehydration system
              and all above yard piping. The scope also included modernizing the
              facility by converting valve actuators from power gas to
              instrument air and replacement of the existing compressor headers.
              The HMI consoles were relocated from the control room to the
              auxiliary building.

            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>
              Tecnicoe was contracted to design and construct a compressor
              station and gas treating facility located in Silt, Colorado.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facility contains gas compression and treating equipment with
              a handling capacity of 40 MMSCFD. This project had unique
              challenges due to the accessibility of the location. Detailed
              construction planning had to be done due to the remote location
              and weather challenges. The facility was designed to allow for
              future expansion up to 150 MMSCFD.
